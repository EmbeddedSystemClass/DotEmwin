The Emergency Managers Weather Information Network -- EMWIN -- is a service that allows users to obtain weather
forecasts, warnings, and other information directly from the National Weather Service (NWS) in almost real time.
EMWIN is intended to be used primarily by emergency managers and public safety officials who need timely weather
information to make critical decisions. EMWIN consists of a round-the-clock data feed of current weather warnings,
watches, images from NESDIS, advisories, forecasts,and other products issued by the National Weather Service.
